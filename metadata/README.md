Important considerations:
- The C3H10_10X_Metadata_exp* files link barcode sequences to TF-IDs (first column). Those can then be linked to individual conditions using the [TFseq_assignment_allExp.xlsx](TFseq_assignment_allExp.xlsx).
- Experiments 7-14 were conducted using 10X 3' V3.1. Experiments 5 and 6 were conducted using 10X 3' V2.
- Combinations were included in experiments 12-13. Information for those can be found in [C3H10_10X_Metadata_exp12-13_combination.txt](C3H10_10X_Metadata_exp12-13_combination.txt).
- All TFs were overexpressed in confluent conditions. Negative controls for those samples are present as "D0_confluent". Some other experiments, e.g. adipogenesis induction, were performed in non-confluent conditions, for which the control is present as "D0".
- Experiment 14 contains a repeat, at higher power levels, of many TFs that were already performed in earlier experiments.
- The "mCherry-BCXX" barcodes were used internally to design the cell lineage studies (adipocyte, myocytes, and osteoblast differentiation). This information can be found in [C3H10_10X_Metadata.xlsx](C3H10_10X_Metadata.xlsx).
- Only a subset of cells responded to the adipogenesis stimulus. These are included in [Adipo_ref_cells.txt](Adipo_ref_cells.txt).
